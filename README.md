### What exactly?

I'm developing app for climbers with guide to Jura region in Poland. <br />
Because React Native is not able to fully handle three.js with camera controls, model viewer is extracted as web app and will be available in web view in native app. 

### Built With

- Javascript
- Typescript
- React
- Thre
- Tailwind
